### Project Overview

This report aimed to create a comprehensive business performance analysis, focusing on key metrics such as sales, profit, and tax implications. The analysis was achieved using POWERBI.
The report analyzed data from 2013 to 2014 and compared Q4 results between both years. Additionally, it identified the key drivers of business performance, highlighted underperforming products, and provided recommendations to optimize profitability and strategic decision-making.
The key metrics include number of sales, sales proportion, financial performance, sales trends, and tax reports.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "office_supply.csv"file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools
-Excel - Data Cleaning
-PowerBI - Creating reports


### Data Cleaning Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Create a report overview for: 
a. Segment
b. State
c. Product
2. Produce a report on all products sold between January and December 2014,
showing number of sales, sales proportions and financial performance. Ensure
your analysis can be used to determine whether thereis growth or decline on
any of the product lines.
Compare 2013 Q4 and 2014 Q4 figures to highlight year on year results.
Reproduce the report at higher levels such as Product category and State.
3. What key products are the drivers of performance?
4. If we would like to discontinue any product sub dueto poor outcomes, what
would this be?
5. What product do we pay the
highest tax on?
a. Overall
b. For each state
c. For each segment

### Key Findings

The analysis are summarized as follows;
- During this review, Government has the highest Gross sales of 56.40 million among other segments.
All the states did well but Oyo State has the highest Gross sales with a total of 27.26 million as at the period of this review.
Biro has the highest Gross sales of 35.61 million among all other products.
- Across segments, Small Business made the highest profit of 25.90 million.
Biro, Pencil, and A4 Paper are the top 3 products with the highest profit but Biro, among other products, drives the majority of sales and profit of 28.86 million.
Across the States, Osun State made the highest profit with a total of 2.16 million.
- Comparing the figures for total revenue in 2013 and 2014, there was a significant growth of  249.96%.
Also, comparing the figure for total profit in 2013 and 2014, there was a substantial growth of 547.56%.
In all, there is a significant growth in sales and profit. These show a positive year-end growth

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we ecommend the following;
- The business should continue investing in top-performing products and explore opportunities to expand these offerings across other regions.
- Products consistently generating low sales and profit should be considered for discontinuation to optimize resources and reduce unnecessary expenses.
- Implement targeted marketing campaigns in states and segments that show potential but are currently underperforming andÂ lagging in sales.
- Revise the pricing or discount strategies for these regions to stimulate growth.
- Consider optimizing the product mix and adjusting pricing to reduce the tax burden without sacrificing profit.
- Implement a cost-control strategy to maintain or increase profit margins while managing tax liabilities effectively.
- Continue monitoring quarterly performance with a focus on achieving consistent year-on-year growth in Q4 and other critical periods.
